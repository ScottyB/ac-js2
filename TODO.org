* Features
  - Need to handle a function call with params i.e. jQuery("#hello", aHtml + test).
  - Possibly support multiple files
  - Look at completing in a closure
  - Extend current property completion to handle chaining
  - Look at jedi.el for showing parameters when in function parameter list
  - Add tests
  - Add to a package manager
  - Suport auto completion in the repl
  - Add support for documentation of prototypes
  - Need to be able to traverse the ast for a prototype
* Bugs:
  - show wrong candidates when switching objects first time
  - auto completion sometimes requires "." to be entered twice
  - third function in prototype chain wont complete
  - local variables and functions don't show initial values i.e. aren't evaluated
    Causes wrong intial value to be shown if name is present in the main scope
* Ideas
  - Add yasnippet expansion when calling functions
