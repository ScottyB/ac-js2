* Features
  - Need to handle a function call with params i.e. jQuery("#hello", aHtml + test).
  - Possibly support multiple files
  - Look at completing in a closure
  - Extend current property completion to handle chaining
  - Look at jedi.el for showing parameters when in function parameter list
  - Add tests
  - Add to a package manager
  - Suport auto completion in the repl
  - Add support for documentation of prototypes
* Bugs:
  - Make sure the repl only prints results once independent of the number of clients
  - show wrong candidates when switching objects first time
  - auto completion sometimes requires "." to be entered twice
  - third function in prototype chain wont complete
